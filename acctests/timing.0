GPTLget_overhead: using hash entry 414=donothing for getentry estimate
Total overhead of 1 GPTL start or GPTLstop call=6e-08 seconds
Components are as follows:
Fortran layer:             0.0e+00 =   0.0% of total
Get thread number:         3.0e-09 =   5.0% of total
Generate hash index:       1.0e-08 =  16.7% of total
Find hashtable entry:      8.0e-09 =  13.3% of total
Underlying timing routine: 3.5e-08 =  58.3% of total
Misc start/stop functions: 4.0e-09 =   6.7% of total

NOTE: If GPTL is called from C not Fortran, the 'Fortran layer' overhead is zero
NOTE: For calls to GPTLstart_handle()/GPTLstop_handle(), the 'Generate hash index' overhead is zero
NOTE: For auto-instrumented calls, the cost of generating the hash index plus finding
      the hashtable entry is 0.0e+00 not the 1.8e-08 portion taken by GPTLstart
NOTE: Each hash collision roughly doubles the 'Find hashtable entry' cost of that timer

If overhead stats are printed, they are the columns labeled self_OH and parent_OH
self_OH is estimated as 2X the Fortran layer cost (start+stop) plust the cost of 
a single call to the underlying timing routine.
parent_OH is the overhead for the named timer which is subsumed into its parent.
It is estimated as the cost of a single GPTLstart()/GPTLstop() pair.
Print method was full_tree.

If a '%_of' field is present, it is w.r.t. the first timer for thread 0.
A '*' in column 1 below means the timer had multiple parents, though the
values printed are for all calls.
Further down the listing may be more detailed information about multiple
parents. Look for 'Multiple parent info'

GPU timing stats
GPTL could handle up to 20 warps (640 threads)
This setting can be changed with: GPTLsetoption(GPTLmaxthreads_gpu,<number>)
19 = max warpId found
19 = max warpId timed
Only warps which were timed are counted in the following stats
Overhead estimates self_OH and parent_OH are for warp with 'maxcount' calls
OHD estimate assumes Fortran, and non-handle routines used
Actual overhead can be reduced by using 'handle' routines and '_c' Fortran routines

name            = region name
calls           = number of invocations across all timed warps
warps           = number of timed warps for which region was timed at least once
holes           = number of timed warps for which region was never timed (maxwarpid_timed + 1 - nwarps(region)
wallmax (warp)  = max wall time (sec) taken by any timed warp for this region, followed by the warp number
wallmin (warp)  = min wall time (sec) taken by any timed warp for this region, followed by the warp number
maxcount (warp) = max number of times region invoked by any timed warp, followed by the warp number
mincount (warp) = min number of times region invoked by any timed warp, followed by the warp number
negcntmx (warp) = if a region ever had a negative interval, the biggest count is printed along with the warp number responsible
self_OH         = estimate of GPTL overhead (sec) in the timer incurred by 'maxcount' invocations of it
parent_OH       = estimate of GPTL overhead (sec) in the parent of the timer incurred by 'maxcount' invocations of it
